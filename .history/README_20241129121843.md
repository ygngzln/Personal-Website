# Personal Website 
>Link: https://yigengl.vercel.app

This is just my personal website to contain information about me and highlight my projects. I'm open to suggestions and criticism on this website or any other projects I own. You can report any bugs or issues in my projects here as well. 

You can contact me at ygngzln@gmail.com. <br>

Programmed by me. Heavy graphic design aid by another person who prefers to remain anonymous. All background images from Pinterest.

### 2.2 (11/29/2024) - Patch 2
- **Blogs Page Fix** - Fixed an error with the fonts being wonky on mobile
- Fixed a font not loading
- **Cleanup** - Deleted more unnecessary fonts, moved some stranded fonts over to main file
- Mobile issues - Fixed some minor mobile issues
- **QNA** - Quality of life for suggestions text (prevented access before data load and err messages if your message fails to go through filter)

### 2.1 (11/28/2024) - Patch 1
- **Blogs Page Fix** - Fixed an error with the images not loading
- **Cleanup** - Assets page cleanup for unnecessary assets, fonts deletion for unused fonts, changed a font name to match file name
- **About Me Page** - Minor change in hobbies text
- Made minor patches smaller in size compared to the major change

## 2.0 (11/28/2024) - Yet Another Revamp
- **General Changes** - Restructured how README updates look (as you can see), reduced a lot of bloated and unnecessary code or straight up deleted it, attempted to use less HTML elements, more professional looking, stole a graphic designer to help me, redid a lot (read for more)
- **Changes to Page Setup** - Increased height of footer and navigation bar, changed some colors around to be less weird and out of place, new hover animations for navigation bar, separated a bunch of pages and changed a few minor things, percentage measurements for nav and footer instead of static measurements, nav bar is centered now rather than on the sides of the bar
- **Major changes made to Homepage** - Reduced random splash subtitle text to "Programmer", moved Current Project display to Projects page, added three image button links, changed background, utilized text-shadows for text-background contrast, removed big blocky black opacities
- **Deletion of Homepage drop down tabs** - Gone as they were deemed unnecessary
- **Major changes to About Me Page** - Horizontal information rather than vertical, removed all elements of QNA from this page to separate it into another page, much easier on the eyes, added background, added special title, rewrote about me texts, added and redefined hobbies and goals, complete do-over because the old one looked horrifying to read
- **Updates/Blogs Changes** - Split original Blogs page into two pages, Updates and Blogs as I considered my previous "Blogs" to actually just be updates
- **Updates Page** - Made much easier to read, sped up fade-in animations for the sake of it, restructured updates so the date is on the side instead of the top, added background image
- **Blogs Page** - Added two articles and created link boxes for them, added background and title, wrote two small minimal blog posts (mostly low-effort)
- **QNA Page** - Separated from About Me Page, now contains better system, also backend change to send the date of the suggestion, mostly the same otherwise except a bunch of design changes, added background, better fonts
- **Projects Page** - Used grid system for projects and deleted a lot of unnecessary info, made entire box the link for the project, added background and new title, added current project info below on this page
- **Mobile support** - Changed mobile support stuff and used rem and em measurements a lot more, still have a lot to change here

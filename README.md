# Personal Website 
>Link: https://yigengl.vercel.app

This is just my personal website to contain information about me and highlight my projects. I'm open to suggestions and criticism on this website or any other projects I own. You can report any bugs or issues in my projects here as well. 

You can contact me at ygngzln@gmail.com. <br>

**Credits:**
Programmed by me. Heavy graphic design aid by another person who prefers to remain anonymous.

## 2.0 () - Yet Another Revamp
- **General Changes** - Restructured how README updates look (as you can see), reduced a lot of bloated and unnecessary code or straight up deleted it, attempted to use less HTML elements, more professional looking, stole a graphic designer to help me, redid a lot (read for more)
- **Changes to Page Setup** - Increased height of footer and navigation bar, changed some colors around to be less weird and out of place, new hover animations for navigation bar, separated a bunch of pages and changed a few minor things, percentage measurements for nav and footer instead of static measurements
- **Major changes made to homepage** - Reduced splash subtitle text to "Programmer", removed Current Project display, added three button links, changed background, utilized text-shadows, removed drop-down displays, removed big blocky black opacities
- **Major changes to about me page** - Horizontal information rather than vertical, removed all elements of QNA from this page to separate it into another page, much easier on the eyes, added background, added special title, rewrote about me texts, added and redefined hobbies and goals, added links for some parts, complete do-over because the old one looked horrifying to read
